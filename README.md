# Enhancing-USB-Security-A-Multi-Layered-Framework-for-Detecting-Mitigating-BadUSB-Attacks
This is my USB Guard project. A research-driven framework that unites cybersecurity and AI/ML. It integrates behavioral analysis, power profiling, metadata validation, CAPTCHA-based verification, and adaptive anomaly detection to identify and prevent evolving BadUSB and hardware-level threats.
